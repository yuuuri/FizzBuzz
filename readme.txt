1.	Complete the exercise on p. 143 of Chapter 4, “FizzBuzz.”  Wrap your program in a function called fizzbuzz_1(), and arrange for the output to appear in a web page.  Do the same for steps 2-5.

2.	Create a function fizzbuzz_2(start, end) that takes the starting and ending numbers as parameters.  Call fizzbuzz_2(200, 300).

3.	Create a function fizzbuzz_3(arr) that takes an array of numbers to use instead of counting by itself.  Call fizzbuzz_3([101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115]).

4.	Create a function fizzbuzz_4(obj) that takes an object specifying the words to be printed instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz".  Call fizzbuzz4({ divisibleByThree: "foo", divisibleByFive: "bar"}).

5.	Combine steps (3) and (4) to create fizzbuzz_5(arr, obj).
